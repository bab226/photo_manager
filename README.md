# README for photo manager.

by Bryan Bogin

Created for photography enthusiasts and digital minamilists who want to tag, organize, and minimize their photo collections...sometimes less is more!
This script will a) delete duplicates of your photos, b) tag photos with informative labels (people, dates, objects), and c) identify poor quality photos that could be deleted.
